//This code is for the function that ranks rows in Power Query grouping by one column.

(tabletorank as table) as table =>
     let
      SortRows = Table.Sort(tabletorank,{{"Sales", Order.Descending}}),
      AddIndex = Table.AddIndexColumn(SortRows, "Rank", 1, 1)
     in
      AddIndex
      
//tabletorank is the previous step in your M code.
